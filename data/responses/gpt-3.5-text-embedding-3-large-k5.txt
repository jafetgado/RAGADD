Patients report that Concerta provides a more subtle and focused effect compared to Adderall, which is described as a sledgehammer slamming the brain into focus. Some individuals find Concerta to be better for focus, with fewer side effects like anxiety and sleep disturbances, while Adderall is noted to be effective but may not suppress appetite as much as Concerta.
Patients report positive personality changes during treatment with Guanfacine or Intuniv, such as improved communication, emotional control, compliance, focus, and reduced impulsivity. Some individuals also experience increased agreeableness, less emotional reactivity, and better memory retention. However, there are instances of initial side effects like crankiness, sleepiness, and temporary mood changes that may require adjustment.
Patients report that stimulant medications like Adderall and Vyvanse can negatively impact libido or sexual desire. Some individuals experienced a decrease in sex drive while taking these medications, leading to concerns about potential libido issues with prolonged use. Switching to Dexedrine was mentioned as a hopeful solution to improve sexual enjoyment.
Different ADHD medications can have varying effects on emotional regulation and mood variability. Methylphenidates like Ritalin can lead to feeling emotionally flat and hollow inside, while amphetamines like Vyvanse can make a person extremely emotional and volatile, experiencing pleasures intensely but also getting easily upset. Some individuals may require a secondary medication to help balance their mood when taking stimulant medications for ADHD.
The emotional "crash" from ADHD medications is often described as involving severe irritability, anxiety, moodiness, sleepiness, and agitation, typically occurring in the mid-afternoon. Some individuals may experience this crash as uncomfortable and seek to manage it by potentially increasing their medication dosage to prolong its effects and delay the onset of the crash.
Patients report that immediate-release formulations like Concerta provide quick onset of action but can lead to immediate crashes, irritability, and mood swings when the medication wears off. In contrast, extended-release formulations like Vyvanse and Adderall XR offer a more steady and prolonged effect throughout the day, reducing the risk of highs and lows associated with immediate-release medications.
The most difficult side effects to manage with Strattera and Atomoxetine include insomnia, nausea, body aches, headache, irritability, burning urination, suicidal thoughts, sweating, chills, dry mouth, headaches, menstrual irregularities, difficulty urinating, and unusual ejaculations. Strategies commonly used to manage these side effects include prescribing sleep aids for insomnia, accepting trade-offs for improved productivity, and hoping for side effects to diminish over time.
Daytrana, as a patch-based medication, is reported to provide effective and long-lasting symptom relief for ADD. Users appreciate the convenience of the patch format and its ability to maintain medication levels throughout the day. However, some individuals may develop a dependency on Daytrana for focus, experiencing difficulty concentrating without it, which can lead to feelings of being unmotivated or grumpy.
Long-term use of ADHD medications like Adderall and Methylphenidate can lead to potential side effects such as stunted growth, loss of appetite, headaches, palpitations, weight loss, depression, anxiety, and emotional flatness. Monitoring by healthcare providers is crucial due to uncertainties about the comprehensive long-term effects on the body.
Patients in the document reported needing to increase their dosage of Adderall XR after a period of time due to reduced effectiveness. One patient mentioned increasing from 15 mg to 20 mg and noticing a significant improvement in effectiveness. However, concerns were raised about the potential negative consequences of continuously elevating the dosage, such as worries about the impact on health, including liver and kidney function.

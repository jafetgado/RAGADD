Patients report that Concerta is perceived as better than Adderall for some individuals, providing a more subtle and focused effect compared to Adderall's more intense impact on focus. Some individuals find that Concerta helps with focus without significant side effects, while Adderall may lead to more noticeable mood changes and appetite suppression.
Patients report positive personality changes during treatment with Guanfacine or Intuniv, such as improved communication, emotional regulation, focus, and reduced impulsivity. Some individuals also experience increased agreeableness, better behavior, and enhanced self-esteem. However, there are also reports of initial side effects like increased sleepiness, crankiness, and temporary mood changes that may require adjustment.
Patients report that stimulant medications like Adderall and Vyvanse can negatively impact libido or sexual desire. Some individuals experienced a decrease in sex drive while taking these medications, leading to concerns about potential libido issues with prolonged use. Switching to other medications like Dexedrine was mentioned as a hopeful solution to improve sexual enjoyment.
ADHD medications can have varying effects on emotional regulation and mood variability. Some individuals report that Methylphenidates can make them feel emotionless and socially avoidant, while Amphetamines like Adderall and Vyvanse can lead to extreme emotional responses, including heightened joy and increased irritability. It is important to monitor mood changes and consider the need for additional medications to balance emotions.
The emotional "crash" from ADHD medications is often described as involving irritability, anxiety, moodiness, sleepiness, and agitation, typically occurring in the mid-afternoon. Some individuals may experience this crash as uncomfortable and seek to manage it by potentially increasing their medication dosage to prolong its effects.
Patients report that immediate-release formulations like Concerta provide quick onset of action but can lead to immediate crashes, irritability, and mood swings when the medication wears off. On the other hand, extended-release formulations such as Vyvanse and Adderall XR offer a more steady and prolonged effect throughout the day, reducing the likelihood of highs and lows or mood swings. Some individuals prefer extended-release formulations for maintaining a more stable mood and focus without experiencing crashes.
The most difficult side effects to manage with Strattera and Atomoxetine include insomnia, nausea, body aches, headache, irritability, burning urination, suicidal thoughts, sweating, chills, dry mouth, headaches, menstrual irregularities, difficulty urinating, and unusual ejaculations. Strategies commonly used to manage these side effects include adjusting the dosage, prescribing sleep aids like Trazadone, and accepting trade-offs for improved productivity.
Daytrana, as a time-release patch, is favored over pills by some patients for better medication duration. Users report minimal skin irritation but mention a potential dependency issue, feeling unmotivated and grumpy without the patch. Despite this, the patch is praised for its effectiveness in maintaining focus and behavior stability, allowing for extended wear times to manage tasks and avoid impulse control issues.
Long-term use of ADHD medications like Adderall and Methylphenidate can lead to potential side effects such as stunted growth, loss of appetite, headaches, palpitations, weight loss, depression, anxiety, and emotional flatness. Monitoring by healthcare providers is crucial due to uncertainties about the comprehensive long-term effects of these medications on the body.
Patients in the document reported needing to increase their dosage of Adderall XR after experiencing reduced effectiveness over time. Some individuals mentioned escalating from 15 mg to 20 mg or from 20 mg to 30 mg due to diminishing effects on attention and impulsivity. However, escalating doses led to concerns about potential negative consequences such as increased side effects like dizziness, speech difficulties, and headaches, as well as worries about long-term health effects and the need for additional medications to manage symptoms.

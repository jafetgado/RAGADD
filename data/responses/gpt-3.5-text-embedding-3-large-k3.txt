Both Concerta and Adderall are reported to improve focus, with Concerta described as providing a more subtle and artistic focus compared to Adderall's more intense effect.

ADHD medications like Vyvanse can lead to emotional variability, with some individuals experiencing extreme emotions and heightened sensitivity to pleasures.

It is important to monitor mood changes and consider additional medications to help balance emotions when necessary.
The emotional "crash" from ADHD medications is often characterized by irritability, anxiety, moodiness, sleepiness, and agitation, typically occurring in the mid-afternoon.

Immediate-release ADHD formulations like Concerta provide quick onset of action but can lead to abrupt crashes when the medication wears off, causing irritability and anger.

Patients report needing to increase the dosage of Adderall XR to maintain effectiveness, with one individual mentioning going from 15 mg to 20 mg and another from 20 mg to 30 mg.

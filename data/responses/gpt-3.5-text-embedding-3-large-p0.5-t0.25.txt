Patients report that Concerta and Adderall both help with focus, but in different ways. Concerta is described as providing subtle, masterful focus, while Adderall is likened to a sledgehammer effect on focus. Some individuals find Concerta better for focus, while others feel Adderall works well but may not suppress appetite as much as Concerta. Additionally, Concerta is noted to sometimes lower appetite and cause mood swings, while Adderall is mentioned to help with focus but can lead to anxiety and sleep side effects.
Patients report that after starting Guanfacine or Intuniv, they observe improvements in behavior, focus, mood, impulse control, and communication. Some experience increased compliance, reduced hyperactivity, better self-esteem, and improved academic performance. However, side effects such as initial sleepiness, forgetfulness, irritability, and stomach pain have also been noted in some cases.
Patients report varying effects on libido while taking stimulant medications like Adderall and Vyvanse. Some individuals mention experiencing a decrease in libido, while others note a significant increase in sexual desire. These changes in libido are often accompanied by other effects such as improved focus, weight loss, and mood alterations.
ADHD medications can have varying effects on emotional regulation and mood variability. Some individuals report becoming emotionally volatile and experiencing extreme emotions on amphetamines like Adderall and Vyvanse. Others mention feeling emotionally flat or becoming an emotionless robot on methylphenidates such as Concerta. It is important to monitor mood changes and consider the need for additional medications to balance mood when using stimulants for ADHD.
The emotional "crash" from ADHD medications is often described as involving irritability, anxiety, moodiness, sleepiness, and agitation. Patients may experience this crash as the medication wears off, leading to discomfort and agitation. Some individuals may manage this by adjusting their dosage to extend the medication's duration or by seeking additional medications to balance mood.
Immediate-release formulations like Concerta and Adderall provide quick onset of action but may lead to crashes and mood swings as the effects wear off rapidly. On the other hand, extended-release formulations like Vyvanse and Daytrana offer a more steady and prolonged release of medication, reducing the risk of highs and lows throughout the day. However, some patients report that extended-release medications may not always last as long as expected and may require additional doses for sustained effect.
The most difficult side effects to manage reported by patients taking Strattera and Atomoxetine include insomnia, nausea, body aches, irritability, burning urination, suicidal thoughts, menstrual irregularities, dry mouth, headaches, difficulty urinating, frothy ejaculations, constipation, anger, and extreme tiredness. Patients have mentioned using strategies such as seeking medical help for sleep aids, adjusting dosages, managing diet, and considering the trade-off between side effects and improved focus.
Daytrana, a patch-based medication for ADHD, has been reported to provide steady and controlled doses, leading to improved focus, behavior, and school performance. Users have noted benefits such as avoiding impulse control issues, maintaining normalcy in personality, and achieving academic success. However, some experienced skin irritation, decreased appetite, and difficulty sleeping if the patch is worn for an extended period. Overall, the positive outcomes of Daytrana seem to outweigh the negatives for many users.
Long-term use of ADHD medications like Adderall, Methylphenidate, and Amphetamine/dextroamphetamine can lead to various side effects. These may include stunted growth, loss of appetite, headaches, palpitations, depression, anxiety, mood swings, weight loss, emotional flatness, blurred vision, stomach aches, insomnia, liver and kidney concerns, dizziness, and potential dependency issues. Users have reported concerns about the unknown long-term impacts on health, including effects on relationships, emotional well-being, and overall quality of life.
Patients often report that over time, the effectiveness of ADHD medications like Adderall or amphetamine/dextroamphetamine can diminish, leading to the need for dosage increases. However, increasing dosages may result in negative effects such as dizziness, stumbling over words, headaches, increased sweating, higher pulse rate, higher blood pressure, lower quality of sleep, and muscle tension. Some individuals also express concerns about potential long-term health effects and dependency on the medication.

Adderall is reported to help with focus and relaxation in individuals with ADHD, while Concerta is mentioned to work better for some individuals but may suppress appetite more than Adderall. Adderall XR, when combined with immediate-release Adderall, is noted to improve focus, organization, and energy levels, but may cause chest tightness and anxiety at higher doses for some individuals.
Patients report mixed experiences with personality changes during treatment with Guanfacine or Intuniv. Some mention improvements in behavior, such as better sleep and fewer meltdowns, while others describe negative effects like increased hyperactivity and issues in class. Individual responses to the medications vary.

ADHD medications like Adderall, Amphetamine/dextroamphetamine, Lisdexamfetamine, and Vyvanse are reported to provide consistent control of ADHD symptoms without drastic mood swings or emotional variability. Some users mention sustained attention, consistent energy levels, and motivation without experiencing elation, high feelings, or hyperactivity. Bupropion, however, is noted to have little to no effect on ADHD symptoms.
Patients report that ADHD medications like Methylphenidate, Methylin ER, Adderall XR, and Amphetamine/dextroamphetamine help with focus and managing emotions. They mention improvements in daily tasks, anxiety relief, and better emotional reactions. However, some still experience forgetfulness and varying responses in different areas.
Immediate-release ADHD formulations like Adderall IR and extended-release formulations like Adderall XR may have similar durations of action for some individuals, lasting around four hours. However, extended-release formulations like Vyvanse can provide a longer dosing window, lasting up to 12 hours, with potentially improved side-effect profiles. Vyvanse is noted for reducing side effects without compromising efficacy, making it a recommended option for individuals unsatisfied with their current ADHD management.
The document does not mention specific side effects that are difficult to manage or strategies typically used to manage them.
Daytrana is reported to help children function throughout the day without outbursts, provide the right focus without hyperfocusing, and have fewer digestive side effects compared to other medications.
Patients report varied experiences with long-term side effects of ADHD medications. Some find medications like Adderall and Dextroamphetamine to control symptoms with no side effects, while others experience too many side effects with Atomoxetine and discontinue its use. Individual responses to long-term ADHD medication use differ.
Dosage adjustments are sometimes needed to maintain effectiveness, as seen with a patient increasing from 1mg to 2mg of Guanfacine. However, increasing dosage can lead to side effects such as bedwetting, as reported in the patient's experience. Some patients also mention feeling that the dose recommendation may be too low for optimal effectiveness, as noted with Mydayis and Vyvanse.

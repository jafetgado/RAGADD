Patients report that Concerta provides a more subtle and focused effect compared to Adderall, which is described as a stronger, more intense focus. Some individuals find Concerta to be better at finessing thoughts into focus, while Adderall is likened to a sledgehammer effect on the brain. Additionally, Concerta may lead to mood swings, appetite suppression, and irritability, while Adderall is noted to be more effective in initiating tasks.

Patients report positive personality changes while on Guanfacine or Intuniv, such as improved communication, increased emotional expression, better focus, reduced impulsivity, and enhanced self-esteem. Some individuals also experience decreased irritability, improved compliance, and overall better behavior. However, there are also reports of initial side effects like tiredness, crankiness, and increased forgetfulness, which may vary in intensity and duration.

Patients report varying effects on libido while taking stimulant medications like Adderall and Vyvanse. Some individuals mention experiencing a decrease in libido, while others note a significant increase in sexual desire. These changes in libido are often accompanied by other effects such as improved focus, weight loss, and mood alterations.

ADHD medications can have varying effects on emotional regulation and mood variability. Some individuals report feeling emotionally volatile, experiencing extreme joy or irritability with amphetamines like Adderall or Vyvanse. Others mention feeling emotionally blunted or hollow inside with methylphenidates, such as Concerta, leading to difficulties in maintaining relationships. It is important to monitor mood changes and consider additional medications to balance emotions when necessary.

The emotional "crash" from ADHD medications is often described as involving irritability, anxiety, moodiness, sleepiness, and agitation. Patients may experience this crash as the medication wears off, leading to discomfort and agitation. Some individuals mention trying to manage the crash by adjusting their dosage or timing of medication intake.

Patients report that immediate-release formulations like Concerta provide quick onset of action but can lead to immediate crashes and irritability once the medication wears off. On the other hand, extended-release formulations like Vyvanse and Adderall XR offer a more steady and sustained release of medication, reducing mood swings and irritability. However, some patients find that extended-release medications may not last as long as expected and may require additional booster doses for optimal effect.

The most difficult side effects to manage with Strattera and Atomoxetine include insomnia, nausea, body aches, irritability, suicidal thoughts, urinary issues, sexual side effects, heavy menstrual cycles, dry mouth, headaches, and constipation. Patients often require additional medications like Trazadone for sleep or may need to adjust dosages to alleviate side effects. Some individuals find that side effects diminish over time, while others may need to discontinue the medication due to intolerable side effects.

Daytrana, a patch-based medication, has been reported to provide steady and controlled doses, improving focus and behavior in individuals with ADHD. Users mention benefits such as avoiding impulse control issues, maintaining normal daily routines, and achieving academic success. However, some users experience side effects like skin irritation, decreased appetite, and difficulty falling asleep if the patch is worn for an extended period.

Long-term use of ADHD medications such as Adderall, Methylphenidate, and Amphetamine/dextroamphetamine can lead to various side effects. These may include stunted growth, loss of appetite, headaches, palpitations, depression, anxiety, mood swings, weight loss, emotional flatness, liver and kidney concerns, blurred vision, stomach aches, insomnia, personality changes, dizziness, liver and kidney issues, muscle spasms, trouble with sleep, and potential dependency issues. Users also report concerns about the impact on heart health, libido, and potential unknown long-term effects on health.

Based on the patient reviews, it is common for individuals to experience a decrease in the effectiveness of their ADHD medication over time, leading to a need for dosage adjustments to maintain the desired effects. Some consequences reported include developing negative side effects like dizziness, stumbling over words, headaches, increased sweating, higher pulse rate, higher blood pressure, lower quality of sleep, and muscle tension. Additionally, concerns about dependency on the medication and potential long-term health effects are also mentioned.

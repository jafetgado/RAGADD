When taking Adderall or Vyvanse, some individuals report an increase in libido or sexual desire, which can be considered a positive outcome.

Emotional "crash" from ADHD medications is often described as feeling irritable, agitated, sleepy, moody, and anxious, typically occurring as the medication wears off.

Based on the patient reviews, immediate-release ADHD formulations provide quick relief and possibly lead to mood swings and irritability when they wear off, while extended-release formulations offer a more steady supply of medication throughout the day with less risk of highs and lows.

Some individuals also report negative effects on relationships and experience challenges managing emotions while on extended medication use.

Based on the patient reviews, some individuals have needed to increase their dosage of medications like Adderall XR or Adderall to maintain effectiveness. This increase was due to noticing decreased attention span, impulsive behavior, or treatment plateauing.

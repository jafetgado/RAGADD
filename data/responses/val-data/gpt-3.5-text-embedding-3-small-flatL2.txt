Patients report that Concerta provides a more subtle and focused effect compared to Adderall, which is described as a more intense and immediate focus. While Concerta is praised for its ability to enhance concentration and work efficiency, some users note a decrease in appetite and occasional mood changes, such as reduced passion or humor. Adderall, on the other hand, is mentioned to have stronger effects on focus but may lead to anxiety, sleep issues, and more side effects.

Patients report a range of personality changes during treatment with Guanfacine or Intuniv. Some experience improved behavior, increased agreeableness, reduced emotional reactivity, better memory, and overall better behavior. Others may experience extreme tiredness, irritability, mood swings, and even suicidal thoughts. Responses vary, with some individuals benefiting greatly from the medication while others may experience negative side effects.

Patients report a drastic decline in sex drive while taking Vyvanse, with one individual mentioning a more intense dry mouth compared to other stimulants. Additionally, a patient who switched from Adderall to Vyvanse noted a decrease in energy levels and occasional struggles with motivation.

ADHD medications like Vyvanse can initially help with ADHD symptoms but may lead to emotional side effects such as extreme emotional days, mood swings, and feelings of low mood or agitation as tolerance builds up. Methylphenidate is reported to work well as a mood stabilizer but can lead to rage during the coming down period. Atomoxetine is noted to help stabilize mood and reduce grouchiness, with some concerns about its impact on short-term memory.

Patients often report that after taking ADHD medications like Vyvanse, Adderall XR, or Quillivant XR, they experience improved emotional regulation, better concentration, and reduced impulsivity. However, some side effects like dry mouth, insomnia, loss of appetite, or a decrease in the excitement of thoughts may occur. It is important to manage the timing of medication intake to avoid sleep disturbances.

Patients report that immediate-release ADHD formulations like Adderall provide quick symptom relief but may come with strong stimulant effects and side effects like euphoria, anxiety, and teeth grinding. On the other hand, extended-release formulations such as Vyvanse offer a more steady and sustained effect without mood swings or irritability when wearing off, providing consistent focus without the immediate crash experienced with some immediate-release medications.

The most difficult side effects to manage with Strattera include skin rash, headaches, severe stomach cramps, and fatigue leading to difficulty falling asleep and morning tiredness.

Daytrana, a time-release patch for ADD, is reported to be effective in helping individuals focus and maintain concentration.

Despite these drawbacks, many users found the benefits of improved focus and academic performance outweighed the negatives associated with Daytrana.

Long-term use of ADHD medications like Adderall and amphetamine/dextroamphetamine can lead to decreased effectiveness over time, potentially causing individuals to feel trapped by the drug and experience little benefit. Users may also face concerns about discontinuation symptoms, such as an inability to quit, as well as side effects like high blood pressure, low libido, binge eating, and mood changes. Additionally, worries about the long-term impacts on health, including effects on sex life and the inability to take the medication while pregnant or nursing, may arise.

Patients report that the effectiveness of Adderall and Adderall XR can wear off over time, leading to a need for dosage adjustments to maintain benefits. Some individuals experience a quick tolerance build-up, requiring increases in dosage for sustained effects. Concerns about potential negative health impacts from continuously elevating the strength of the medication have been raised.

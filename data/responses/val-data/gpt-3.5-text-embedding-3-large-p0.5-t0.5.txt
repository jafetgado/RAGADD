Patients report that Concerta and Adderall both help with focus, but in different ways. Concerta is described as providing subtle, masterful focus without suppressing appetite as much as Adderall. Some individuals find Concerta to be more effective for them, while others experience side effects like lowered appetite and mood swings. Adderall, on the other hand, is noted for its more intense focus but may lead to anxiety and sleep side effects for some users.

Patients report that after starting Guanfacine or Intuniv, they observe improvements in behavior, focus, mood, and impulse control. Some experience increased cooperativeness, better sleep, and academic performance. However, side effects such as initial tiredness, irritability, forgetfulness, increased appetite, and stomach pain have also been noted.

Patients report varied effects on libido while taking stimulant medications like Adderall and Vyvanse. Some individuals experience a decrease in libido, while others note a significant increase. Additionally, some mention concerns about potential libido issues with prolonged use of these medications.

ADHD medications can have varying effects on emotional regulation and mood variability. Some individuals report feeling emotionally volatile, experiencing extreme joy or irritability with amphetamines like Adderall or Vyvanse. Others mention feeling emotionally blunted or becoming more emotionally stable with medications like Methylphenidate. It is important to monitor mood changes and consider additional medications to balance mood if needed.

The emotional "crash" from ADHD medications is often described as involving irritability, anxiety, moodiness, sleepiness, and agitation. Patients may also experience a decrease in energy levels. To manage this, some individuals consider adjusting their dosage to extend the medication's effects or seek additional medications to help balance their mood.

Immediate-release formulations like Concerta and Adderall provide quick onset of action but may lead to crashes and mood swings as the effects wear off rapidly. Extended-release formulations like Vyvanse and Daytrana offer a more steady and prolonged release of medication, reducing the need for multiple doses throughout the day and minimizing mood swings. However, some patients report that extended-release medications may not always last as long as expected and may require additional booster doses for optimal effect.

The most difficult side effects to manage reported by patients taking Strattera or Atomoxetine include insomnia, nausea, body aches, headache, irritability, urinary issues, sexual side effects, and suicidal thoughts. Patients often use strategies such as adjusting dosage, seeking additional medications for symptom management (e.g., Trazadone for sleep), or accepting the trade-off between side effects and improved productivity.

Daytrana, a patch-based medication, has been reported to provide steady and controlled doses, leading to improved focus, behavior, and school performance. Users have noted benefits such as avoiding impulse control issues, maintaining normalcy, and achieving academic success. However, some individuals experienced skin irritation, decreased appetite, and difficulty sleeping if the patch is worn for an extended period.

Long-term use of ADHD medications like Adderall, amphetamine/dextroamphetamine, and methylphenidate can lead to concerns such as stunted growth, loss of appetite, headaches, palpitations, depression, anxiety, mood swings, weight loss, emotional flatness, liver and kidney issues, high blood pressure, low libido, binge eating, insomnia, blurred vision, stomach aches, whinnying, fussing, sleep disturbances, muscle spasms, trouble with sleep, and potential impact on relationships and emotional well-being. Some users also report concerns about dependency, withdrawal symptoms, and unknown long-term health effects.

Patients often report that over time, the effectiveness of ADHD medications like Adderall or amphetamine/dextroamphetamine can diminish, leading to the need for dosage increases. However, increasing dosages may result in negative consequences such as side effects like dizziness, stumbling over words, headaches, increased sweating, higher pulse rate, higher blood pressure, lower quality of sleep, and muscle tension. Some individuals also express concerns about potential long-term health effects and dependency on the medication.

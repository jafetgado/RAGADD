After starting Intuniv, children often experience increased calmness, reduced hyperactivity, and better focus. Some reports also mention drowsiness, fatigue, moodiness, and emotional blunting, especially at higher doses. A few parents note increased irritability or aggression during dosage adjustments

After switching to Daytrana, some parents report noticeable improvements in focus, task completion, and academic performance. However, others mention issues such as emotional ups and downs, difficulty with the patch staying on, and adverse reactions that interfere with school success. Experiences vary widely across children.

When increasing the Intuniv dosage, commonly observed side effects include excessive sleepiness, fatigue, irritability, emotional flatness, dizziness, and headaches. Some parents also report worsening behavior or a return of ADHD symptoms at higher doses.

Sleep disturbances from medications like Daytrana or Vyvanse are often managed by adjusting the dosage, removing the patch earlier in the day (for Daytrana), or using supplemental medications such as melatonin or Clonidine at night. Some patients also report switching medications to reduce insomnia.

Patients report that Vyvanse often increases social confidence and improves self-esteem. Some describe feeling more outgoing, making new friends, initiating conversations, and participating more in class. One patient mentioned that it helped eliminate fear associated with body image and going outside, while another said they felt like their true self with improved attention. However, some also reported increased irritability, mood swings, or feeling emotionally flat, which negatively affected their social interactions.

Patients taking Vyvanse (Lisdexamfetamine) frequently report decreased appetite and significant weight loss. Examples include adults and children who lost up to 30 pounds or experienced ongoing struggles with eating. Some children became lethargic or sleepy and had to stop the medication due to poor appetite and unhealthy weight loss. A few patients mentioned binge eating on non-medicated days, potentially as a rebound from suppressed appetite during medicated periods

Patients report that both Concerta and Adderall improve focus, but their effects on mood differ. Concerta is described as organizing thoughts and aiding task completion, though some users report emotional flatness, irritability, and depressive symptoms. Adderall is often associated with increased focus, energy, and motivation, and in some cases improved mood and confidence. However, others report mood swings, aggression, anxiety, or emotional crashes when the medication wears off. Some users switched from Concerta to Adderall due to negative mood effects, while others experienced the reverse. The emotional impact appears highly individual and dependent on dosage.

When transitioning between ADHD medications, patients commonly report side effects such as mood swings, increased irritability, emotional flatness, lethargy, headaches, insomnia, appetite changes, and digestive issues. Some individuals experience worsened focus or return of hyperactive symptoms. Others note improvements after adjustments in dosage or timing, while some discontinue new medications due to intolerable effects. Experiences vary widely across individuals and medications

Based on patient reports, Strattera can begin positively affecting attention span within the first few hours for some individuals, while for others it takes about two weeks. Improvements noted include increased focus, enhanced comprehension, and better task completion. However, some patients did not experience noticeable improvements even after several weeks.

Patients taking Focalin XR report a range of emotional and psychological effects. Some experience improved focus and effectiveness, while others describe mood swings, feelings of detachment, emotional sensitivity, or becoming overly quiet or "zombie-like." A few users reported feelings of loneliness, sadness, or being on the verge of tears. In some cases, overmedication was associated with being moody and glassy-eyed. Responses vary, and side effects were sometimes dose-dependent.

When medications like Focalin or Concerta wear off too early in the day, patients commonly address the short duration by adding a booster dose later in the day or switching to a different formulation. For example, one parent mentioned trying a 5 mg afternoon booster of Focalin to extend coverage after noticing that the morning dose wore off by 1 PM. Others described switching to longer-lasting medications like Adderall XR when Concerta and Focalin did not last long enough

To manage side effects like nausea or crankiness while preserving medication benefits, some patients report strategies such as adjusting the dosage timing (e.g., switching to evening doses), temporarily lowering the dose, adding a supplemental dose later in the day, or pairing medications (e.g., using melatonin for sleep, or combining with another medication to smooth out behavioral shifts). In several cases, side effects diminished over time or were reduced by finding the optimal dose balance. Parents also note working closely with their doctor to monitor effects and make gradual changes based on the child's response

During treatment with Guanfacine or Intuniv, personality changes reported by patients or caregivers include increased calmness and agreeableness, reduced emotional reactivity, and better behavior. However, some also describe negative changes such as emotional flatness, lethargy, stuttering, irritability, crankiness, loss of playfulness, and becoming "zombie-like." These effects varied with dosage and individual response

Several patients reported a loss of symptom control after switching from brand-name Intuniv to generic Guanfacine. One parent noted that their child's ADHD symptoms returned within a week after switching, alongside new and potentially dangerous side effects. Another described their child becoming excessively tired, emotionally flat, and less playful on Guanfacine, despite improved focus. Attempts to adjust dosing were unsuccessful, and symptom control remained inferior compared to the brand-name medication

Patients commonly discontinue stimulant medications due to side effects such as severe weight loss, insomnia, emotional blunting, mood swings, tics, aggression, and personality changes. These adverse effects often prompt a switch to non-stimulant alternatives like Intuniv or Strattera when stimulants either stop being effective or produce intolerable reactions

Patients report that stimulant medications like Adderall and Vyvanse can reduce libido or sexual desire. Some individuals specifically mention experiencing lower libido or weak erections while on these medications. However, a few also noted no impact or even a possible increase in libido, indicating that sexual side effects vary across individuals

Patients reported discontinuing medications due to side effects such as severe lethargy, emotional instability, seizures, stuttering, persistent nausea, dizziness, mood swings, aggression, extreme personality changes, and loss of peripheral vision. In several cases, side effects like heart palpitations, chest pain, suicidal thoughts, or manic symptoms were also cited as reasons to stop the medication. These effects were considered severe enough to outweigh any therapeutic benefits and prompted immediate cessation or switching of drugs

For Atomoxetine, initial side effects such as headaches, insomnia, dry mouth, dizziness, or mood changes are commonly reported in the first few days to weeks. These effects often subside over time for some users. Multiple patients noted improvements in focus, reduced distractions, and increased productivity after a few weeks, with some explicitly stating that the benefits outweighed the temporary discomfort. However, others experienced ongoing or severe side effects—such as emotional blunting or insomnia—that led them to discontinue the medication. The perception of whether the benefits were worth the side effects varied by individual experience

Patients report that Wellbutrin (Bupropion) can help improve focus, mood, and energy, with some describing it as life-changing for managing ADHD. Compared to traditional stimulants, Wellbutrin may have fewer appetite or libido-related side effects. However, some individuals experienced adverse reactions at lower doses or reported that Wellbutrin was ineffective until increased. In contrast, stimulants like Adderall and Vyvanse were often described as highly effective for focus and academic or work performance, but also commonly associated with side effects such as insomnia, appetite suppression, mood swings, or dependency. The effectiveness and side effects of both options vary significantly between individuals.

ADHD medications have varied effects on emotional regulation and mood. Some patients report improved calmness, reduced impulsivity, and better mood stability. For example, Vyvanse and Adderall are described as helping users feel more focused, confident, and sociable. Others note improvements in behavior and a decrease in emotional outbursts. However, many also experience mood swings, increased irritability, emotional blunting, or depression. Concerta, Focalin, and Intuniv, for instance, were associated in some cases with emotional flatness, crankiness, or becoming "zombie-like." A few users reported increased aggression or anxiety, especially as doses wore off or with certain medications like Strattera or Adderall XR

Patients taking Adderall or Vyvanse frequently report increased motivation and improved ability to complete tasks. With Adderall, individuals describe being more focused, productive, and able to complete work, school assignments, or daily responsibilities. Some note enhanced confidence, mood, and energy levels, allowing them to function more effectively. Vyvanse users often report feeling more organized, attentive, and capable of finishing tasks, with several stating that the medication significantly improved their academic or work performance. However, a few also mention emotional blunting or personality changes that can impact motivation or enjoyment in activities

Patients report several unexpected benefits while using Vyvanse or Concerta. With Vyvanse, individuals mention enhanced social confidence, improved mood, reduced fear associated with body dysmorphia, and the ability to go outdoors more freely. Some also experience increased motivation, better academic performance, and a restored sense of their “true self.” For Concerta, users report becoming more organized, completing tasks more easily, improved social interactions, and even positive feedback from others before recognizing the benefits themselves. A few also mention regaining control over their lives and experiencing emotional well-being not achieved with other medications.

Patients often describe the emotional "crash" after ADHD medications as sudden mood swings, irritability, fatigue, sadness, or emotional flatness once the medication wears off. Some become withdrawn, cry without clear reason, or feel hostile and agitated. Management strategies reported include adjusting dosage timing, adding booster doses, using melatonin for sleep, and switching to medications with a smoother taper or longer duration to reduce the intensity of the crash

Dry mouth is common with Vyvanse, Adderall, and Strattera. Headaches are reported with Vyvanse and Strattera. Insomnia occurs with most stimulants, including Concerta, Focalin, Adderall, and Vyvanse. Strattera can also cause insomnia. Severity and persistence vary by drug and individual

Patients manage appetite suppression from ADHD medications using several strategies: taking medication breaks (such as skipping doses on weekends), eating a large breakfast before the medication takes effect, staying hydrated, and making conscious efforts to eat despite a lack of hunger. Some report that over time, appetite partially returns as the body adjusts. Others mention binge eating on non-medicated days, indicating the importance of maintaining consistent eating habits throughout the week

Children taking ADHD medications reported varied changes in peer and sibling relationships. Some experienced improvements, such as becoming more agreeable, making new friends more easily, and gaining better control over impulsive behaviors, which helped in social settings. Others, however, became moody, irritable, or emotionally flat, leading to increased arguments or distancing from siblings and peers. These effects differed by medication and dosage.

Patients report various types of academic improvements after switching ADHD medications. These include significant grade increases (e.g., from failing to mostly A’s and B’s), improved ability to take notes and participate in class, better organization and task completion, greater motivation, enhanced focus, and better comprehension while studying. Some students noted moving from the bottom to the top of their class within months of starting a new medication

Patients report that immediate-release (IR) ADHD medications often wear off quickly, sometimes within 2–3 hours, leading to the need for multiple doses throughout the day. In contrast, extended-release (XR or ER) formulations provide longer-lasting effects, with some lasting 8–12 hours, reducing the need for redosing. However, some XR medications have been described as causing a harsh “crash” when wearing off, while others provide a smoother taper. IR forms may be preferred when more flexible control over dosing is needed or to supplement XR medications later in the day

With extended use of Adderall or Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse), patients often report improved focus, motivation, and task completion. Over time, some experience reduced emotional variability, increased confidence, and improved academic or work performance. However, a few users note diminishing effects, emotional blunting, irritability, or mood swings after prolonged use. Some also report a return of prior cognitive or emotional challenges when not taking the medication

Patients commonly report experiencing reduced creativity, emotional flatness, or a diminished sense of self while using ADHD medications. One individual on atomoxetine noted feeling less like themselves and found it harder to form relationships due to reduced creativity. Another on methylphenidate mentioned losing their sense of humor and described a shift toward seriousness. A parent also observed that their child, while calmer and more focused on guanfacine, no longer laughed, played, or showed their usual personality, describing them as a “zombie”

Patients most frequently report excessive tiredness, emotional blunting, and appetite suppression as difficult side effects. Strategies to manage these include dose adjustments, timing medication later in the day, using booster doses, switching to brand versions when generics fail, and supplementing with sleep aids like melatonin. Some discontinue the medication entirely if side effects outweigh benefits

Patients report that Daytrana, a patch-based medication, is easy to use and allows for consistent daily routines, with children managing application and removal themselves. The extended effect helps with focus through school and homework. Some users appreciate the control it provides over dosing duration by choosing when to remove the patch. However, others mention drawbacks such as difficulty sleeping if the patch is not removed early, occasional skin irritation, and concerns during supply shortages

Patients report a range of personality-related changes with ADHD medications. Some describe becoming irritable, moody, emotionally flat, or "zombie-like." Others mention increased aggression, emotional blunting, or feeling detached and unlike themselves. A few report snapping at others or experiencing rapid mood swings, while some note improved confidence or social engagement. These effects vary significantly across medications and individuals

Some patients report that ADHD medications can affect sexual function. One person noted a decreased libido while taking Adderall. Another described that Strattera (atomoxetine) enhanced sexual arousal, calling it a “Lady Viagra,” with sensations that made intimacy more intense. A third mentioned that Wellbutrin possibly increased libido. These effects vary by medication and individual experience

After identifying an effective ADHD medication, patients often report significant improvements in focus, organization, and task completion. Many describe better academic or work performance, such as improved grades or productivity. Some also note enhanced social interactions, increased confidence, reduced impulsivity, and the ability to participate more fully in daily life. These effects are frequently described as life-changing or enabling a return to a sense of normalcy

Some patients report that taking breaks from medication on weekends can help restore libido. One individual mentioned experiencing lower libido on Adderall but felt extremely tired on days off, suggesting exercise and healthy eating as helpful strategies. Another patient noted no negative impact on libido while taking Wellbutrin, and possibly even an increase. Adjusting the dose or switching medications was also mentioned as a way to reduce sexual side effects

Changes in classroom behavior following medication adjustments can become noticeable to teachers within a few days. For example, one parent noted that after increasing the Intuniv dose, the doctor advised waiting a few days to observe changes at school, and by the end of that period, the child’s behavior had improved significantly and was described as more agreeable and less emotional

Patients report several long-term side effects from extended use of ADHD medications. These include persistent appetite suppression leading to significant weight loss, insomnia that can become chronic, emotional blunting or mood swings, increased anxiety, and fatigue or emotional crashes when the medication wears off. Some also describe a sense of personality change, such as feeling less humorous or becoming more irritable. In a few cases, patients developed tolerance over time, requiring higher doses or experiencing diminished effects

Patients report mixed effects of ADHD medications on coexisting conditions like anxiety, depression, or ODD. Some note reduced anxiety and better emotional regulation, such as with Vyvanse or Adderall. Others experience worsened mood, increased irritability, or heightened anxiety, particularly with medications like Strattera, Concerta, or Focalin. In certain cases, medications like Intuniv or Kapvay were specifically used to manage ODD and emotional dysregulation, with varying success depending on the individual. Responses differ widely based on medication type, dose, and personal sensitivity

Dosage increases are sometimes required when effectiveness declines, as seen in reviews for medications like Focalin, Vyvanse, and Adderall. Patients report needing booster doses or switching formulations when the effect wears off too early. However, increasing the dosage can lead to side effects such as fatigue, shakiness, irritability, or emotional changes. In some cases, higher doses were described as making patients "zombie-like" or overly sedated, prompting dosage reduction or discontinuation.

Patients commonly report that insurance-related challenges with brand-name ADHD medications include forced switching to generics by insurers, leading to reduced effectiveness or increased side effects. Some reviews describe having to prove failure on generics before brand-name coverage is approved. Others mention high out-of-pocket costs when insurance does not cover the brand-name version, prompting searches for lower-cost international pharmacies or discount programs

Some patients report that Adderall causes a lower libido and weak erections, even when libido remains high. One individual on Atomoxetine (Strattera) described heightened sexual sensation during intimacy, referring to it as “Lady Viagra.” Another patient on Wellbutrin noted no negative impact on libido and possibly an increase. No other medications in the document are described as affecting sexual functioning.

Patients report a wide range of emotional effects from ADHD medications. Some experience significant mood stabilization and reduced emotional reactivity, such as becoming calmer and less cranky on Intuniv or more pleasant and less aggressive with the addition of Kapvay. Others report worsening emotional extremes, including increased sadness, irritability, and emotional flatness, particularly with medications like Concerta, Intuniv, or Vyvanse. A few patients described experiencing rage, mood swings, or crying spells, especially during medication wear-off or as side effects of stimulant use.

Adults taking ADHD medications frequently report enhanced focus, motivation, and emotional stability. Several describe life-changing improvements in productivity and relationships. In contrast, children’s responses often involve changes in behavior, attention, and classroom performance, but may also include concerns such as sleep disturbances, mood swings, or personality changes. Adults sometimes report issues like insomnia, appetite suppression, or emotional blunting, but tend to describe clearer awareness of trade-offs and personal adjustment strategies compared to child-focused reports from parents

When ADHD medication is paused or discontinued temporarily, patients often report feeling extremely tired, disinterested, and lacking motivation. Some describe overeating, a decline in performance or focus, and a return of previous symptoms like impulsivity or emotional instability. Others note feeling like a different, less functional version of themselves until they resume the medication

Dosage timing influenced both effectiveness and side effects across several reviews. For example, a patient on Strattera experienced severe headaches when taking it at night, but switching to a morning dose eliminated the issue. Another patient using Adderall noted that taking it early helped avoid insomnia later. One parent reported that switching Guanfacine from morning to night did not reduce sedation, while others found that adjusting timing (e.g., removing a Daytrana patch early) helped with sleep. These experiences suggest that timing often affects how long the medication lasts and how tolerable the side effects are.

Patients describe stimulant ADHD medications (e.g., Adderall, Vyvanse, Concerta, Focalin) as highly effective for improving focus, attention, and academic or work performance. However, they frequently report side effects such as appetite suppression, insomnia, mood swings, irritability, and occasional emotional blunting or personality changes. In contrast, non-stimulants like Strattera (atomoxetine) and Intuniv (guanfacine) show more variable efficacy. Some patients report benefits like reduced anxiety or better organization, while others experience fatigue, emotional dullness, or minimal symptom improvement. Non-stimulants are also more commonly associated with dizziness, nausea, or sleep disruptions. Effectiveness and tolerability vary widely between individuals.

Patients report several long-term health concerns with ADHD medications, particularly stimulants. These include cardiovascular issues such as increased heart rate, palpitations, and elevated blood pressure. Neurological effects mentioned include insomnia, tics, mood swings, aggression, emotional blunting, and, in rare cases, seizures. Some individuals also experienced vision changes, including blurred or lost peripheral vision, and cognitive or emotional dulling over extended use. Weight loss and appetite suppression were common and sometimes sustained over time

Patients report several gastrointestinal side effects from ADHD medications. Some individuals experienced nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and appetite loss. A few also mentioned weight loss associated with reduced food intake. One patient reported digestive discomfort linked to specific pill binders. Another noted that methylphenidate helped regulate their digestive tract. These effects vary by medication and individual.

Some patients reported hair loss while taking ADHD medications. One person taking Concerta said their hair started falling out. Another reported hair loss on Adderall XR that stopped after switching medications. A third noted experiencing hair loss while on Vyvanse and said their doctor acknowledged it as a known side effect.

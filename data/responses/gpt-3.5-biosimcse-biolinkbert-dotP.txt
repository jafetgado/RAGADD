Adderall is reported to help with focus and relaxation in individuals with ADHD, while also being addictive. Some users find that Concerta works better for focus but note that Adderall does not suppress appetite as much as Concerta. Additionally, Adderall is mentioned to work well in combination with Zoloft for treating mood swings and depressed feelings.
Patients report mixed experiences with personality changes during treatment with Guanfacine or Intuniv. Some individuals find Intuniv to be the best drug for ADD/ADHD, while others report that it did not work for their child, leading to increased hyperactivity and issues in class. One parent noted that while Intuniv helped with their child's sleep, they did not observe significant improvements in behavior.
Based on the patient reviews, there is no direct mention of changes in libido or sexual desire while taking Vyvanse or Adderall. The reviews mainly focus on improvements in confidence, mood, energy, and effectiveness in managing ADHD symptoms.
ADHD medications like amphetamine/dextroamphetamine, Adderall, Lisdexamfetamine, and Vyvanse are reported to provide consistent control of ADHD symptoms without significant mood variability. Patients mention sustained attention, consistent energy levels, and improved focus without experiencing elation, hyperactivity, or drastic evening drop-offs. Bupropion, however, is noted to have little to no effect on ADHD symptoms.
Patients report that ADHD medications like Methylphenidate and Amphetamine/dextroamphetamine help them focus, manage emotions, and improve daily tasks. However, some mention experiencing forgetfulness despite improved focus. The emotional "crash" is not explicitly described in the document.
Extended-release ADHD formulations like Vyvanse provide a longer dosing window (12 hours) compared to immediate-release formulations like Adderall IR, which may only last for four hours. Extended-release formulations may also offer a slightly improved side-effect profile and better management of ADHD symptoms over an extended period.
The most difficult side effects to manage with Vyvanse include extreme anorexia, depression, suicidal ideations, tiredness, and severe anxiety. Strategies typically involve adjusting the dosage to alleviate these symptoms, as they are often a result of taking a dose that is too high.
Daytrana is reported to be the only medication that helps one patient's son function throughout the day without outbursts. This suggests that using a patch-based medication like Daytrana can potentially provide consistent symptom control and improved daily functioning for some individuals.
Based on patient reviews, long-term use of ADHD medications like Adderall, Dextroamphetamine, Vyvanse, and Amphetamine/dextroamphetamine may not result in significant long-term side effects. Patients report that these medications effectively control ADHD symptoms with minimal to no side effects even after extended use ranging from 12 to 16 years.
Patients report varying experiences with dosage adjustments for maintaining effectiveness of ADHD medications. Some mention needing to increase doses due to perceived low efficacy, while others express frustration when providers refuse to raise dosages despite perceived inadequacy. Consequences of dosage adjustments include potential side effects like increased bedwetting when dose is raised from 1mg to 2mg of Guanfacine.

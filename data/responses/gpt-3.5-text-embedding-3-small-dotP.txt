Patients report that Concerta provides a more subtle and focused effect compared to Adderall, which is described as a more intense and immediate focus. While Concerta is praised for its ability to enhance concentration and productivity with minimal personality changes, some users note a decrease in appetite and occasional mood changes. Adderall, on the other hand, is noted for its strong impact on focus but may come with side effects like anxiety and sleep disturbances.
Patients report a range of personality changes during treatment with Guanfacine or Intuniv. Some experience improved behavior, increased agreeableness, better memory, and reduced emotional reactivity.

Responses vary, with some individuals benefiting greatly from the medication while others may experience negative side effects.
Patients report a drastic decline in sex drive while taking Vyvanse, with one individual mentioning a more intense dry mouth compared to other stimulants. Another patient who switched from Adderall to Vyvanse noted a decrease in energy levels and occasional struggles with motivation.
ADHD medications like Vyvanse can initially help with ADHD symptoms but may lead to emotional side effects such as extreme emotional days or mood swings. Some individuals may experience mood disorders or dependency issues with stimulant medications like Vyvanse, leading to low mood, agitation, or emotional instability. Methylphenidate is reported to work well as a mood stabilizer but may cause rage during the coming down period. Atomoxetine is noted to stabilize mood and reduce grouchiness, potentially impacting short-term memory.
Patients often report experiencing improved emotional regulation and clarity of mind while on ADHD medications like Vyvanse, Adderall XR, Methylphenidate, and Quillivant XR. However, some side effects such as dry mouth, insomnia, loss of appetite, and a decrease in the excitement of thoughts may occur. These medications can help with managing symptoms of ADHD, but individual responses and side effects may vary.
Patients report that immediate-release ADHD formulations like Adderall provide quick symptom relief but may come with strong stimulant effects and side effects like euphoria, anxiety, and teeth grinding. On the other hand, extended-release formulations such as Vyvanse offer a more steady and sustained effect without mood swings or irritability when wearing off, but may still cause side effects like dry mouth, jitters, and trouble sleeping.
The most difficult side effects to manage with Strattera include skin rash, headaches, severe stomach cramps, and fatigue leading to difficulty falling asleep and morning tiredness.

Despite these side effects, many users found the benefits of Daytrana to outweigh the negatives and considered it a valuable tool in managing ADHD symptoms.
Long-term side effects of extended ADHD medication use reported by patients include decreased effectiveness over time, feeling trapped by the drug, difficulty discontinuing medication with no improvement in discontinuation symptoms, and deriving little benefit from the medication after several years of use. Patients also express concerns about potential impacts on health, such as high blood pressure, low libido, binge eating when off the medication, and mood changes.
Patients report varying experiences with the need to increase dosage to maintain effectiveness of ADHD medications like Adderall and Vyvanse. Some individuals find that their initial dosage becomes less effective over time, leading them to request dosage adjustments for improved symptom control.

Patients report that Concerta and Adderall both help with focus, but Concerta is described as providing a more subtle and artistically focused improvement compared to the more intense focus experienced with Adderall. Some individuals find Concerta to be better at improving focus without suppressing appetite as much as Adderall. However, Concerta may lead to mood swings, tiredness, and irritability for some users.
Patients report that after starting Guanfacine or Intuniv, they observe positive changes in behavior such as improved communication, reduced emotional outbursts, increased focus, better impulse control, and enhanced mood regulation. Some individuals experience initial side effects like tiredness, irritability, or increased forgetfulness, but these often improve with time. The medication appears to help individuals exhibit their true personalities by reducing symptoms of ADHD and related conditions.
Patients have reported varied effects on libido while taking stimulant medications like Adderall or Vyvanse. Some individuals experienced a decrease in libido, while others noted a significant increase in sexual desire. These changes in libido were often accompanied by other effects such as weight loss, improved focus, and mood changes.
ADHD medications can have varying effects on emotional regulation and mood. Some individuals report feeling emotionally volatile, experiencing extreme joy or easily getting upset over minor issues. Others mention feeling emotionally flat or becoming emotionless while on certain medications, leading to challenges in maintaining relationships. It's important to monitor mood changes and consider additional medications to balance emotions when necessary.
The emotional "crash" from ADHD medications can manifest as irritability, anxiety, moodiness, sleepiness, and agitation, often occurring in the mid-afternoon as the medication wears off. Some individuals may also experience extreme emotions, such as depression, irritability, anger, or feeling emotionally empty during the crash. Managing the crash may involve adjusting medication dosages, switching to different medications, or incorporating strategies like lifestyle changes to minimize side effects.
Patients report that immediate-release formulations like Concerta provide quick onset of action but may lead to immediate crashes and irritability. Extended-release formulations like Vyvanse and Adderall XR offer a steady release of medication throughout the day, reducing mood swings and irritability but may not always last as long as expected, requiring additional doses. Patients also mention that extended-release formulations can take longer to kick in compared to immediate-release options.
The most difficult side effects to manage reported by patients taking Strattera or Atomoxetine include insomnia, nausea, body aches, irritability, burning urination, suicidal thoughts, menstrual cycle disruptions, difficulty urinating, frothy ejaculations, constipation, dry mouth, anger, and extreme tiredness. Patients often try strategies such as adjusting dosage, using sleep aids like Trazadone, accepting trade-offs for improved productivity, or seeking alternative medications due to the severity of these side effects.
Daytrana, a patch-based medication, has shown positive outcomes in improving focus, behavior, and academic performance in individuals with ADHD. Some reported benefits include better impulse control, reduced hyperactivity, improved school performance, and normalized daily routines. However, common side effects include decreased appetite, skin irritation, and potential sleep difficulties if the patch is worn for an extended period.
Long-term use of ADHD medications, such as Adderall, methylphenidate, and amphetamine/dextroamphetamine, can lead to concerns about stunted growth, loss of appetite, headaches, palpitations, depression, anxiety, mood swings, emotional flatness, liver and kidney issues, weight loss, blurred vision, stomach aches, insomnia, dependency, tolerance, high blood pressure, low libido, binge eating, and potential impact on relationships and overall emotional well-being. Users also express worries about the unknown long-term health effects and the challenges of quitting the medication.
Patients often report that over time, the effectiveness of ADHD medications like Adderall or amphetamine/dextroamphetamine may diminish, leading to a need for dosage increases. However, increasing dosages can come with negative consequences such as developing tolerance, experiencing side effects like headaches, dizziness, stumbling over words, and needing additional medications to manage symptoms like headaches. Patients may also express concerns about the long-term impact on health and the potential need for continual dosage adjustments.
